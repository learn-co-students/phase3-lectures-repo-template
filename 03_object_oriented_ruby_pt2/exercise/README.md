## Appointments CLI Part 3

Before starting the Exercise today:
- take a minute to read through the instructions and watch the video (45 seconds long) to see what you're building
- have someone from your breakout room drive (share their screen) and others in the group will help navigate their approach.
### Key Features we're going to add to our Appointments CLI:

- Add the ability to list appointments by doctor
- Add the ability to list appointments by patient

### Key Refactors for Appointments CLI

- Appointment class
  - refactor the `initialize` method to use keyword arguments
  - add a `.all` method that returns all persisted appointments and create an `@@all` class variable to store them in
  - add a `#save` method which persists the `appointment` receiving the method call to `@@all`. This method should return the appointment we call it on.
  - add a `.create` method which accepts attributes as an argument, uses them to instantiate a new instance of the class, and invokes `.save` on the new instance
  - add a `.by_doctor(doctor)` method which accepts a doctor name as an argument and returns all appointments with that doctor.
  - add a `.by_patient(patient)` method which accepts a patient name as an argument and returns all appointments with that patient.
- In CLI
  - Add menu options for viewing appointments by patient and by doctor (done)
    - There are methods in the `appointments_cli.rb` file called `appointments_by_doctor` and `appointments_by_patient` that will be called when the user chooses them from the main menu. The methods are defined for you, but they're currently empty, so you'll need to fill in the logic for those methods.
  - After choosing one of those menu options, create logic to allow users to choose which doctor/patient they want to view the appointments for.
  - rework the parts of the cli that were expecting to find all of our appointments in `APPOINTMENTS` to now use the `Appointment.all` method instead.
    - We'll use `Appointment.all` instead of `APPOINTMENTS` to access the array of all appointments.
    - within the `add_appointment` method, we'll save the appointment using the `#save` method rather than shoveling into the `APPOINTMENTS` constant.

### Logistics

- The code for our cli will be written in the file `lib/appointments_cli.rb`. 
- We'll create another file called `lib/appointment.rb` where we'll define our `Appointment` class
- Again, we'll start our cli application by running the following command in our terminal:

```bash
./bin/run
```
